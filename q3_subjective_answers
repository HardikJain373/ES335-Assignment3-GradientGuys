The results show that the the RMSE value is the least in case of the ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average) model and highest in case of the MA (Moving Average) model. The value of RMSE in case of MLP lies in between these values. Between the ARMA and the MA models, the ARMA model will always perform better because unlike the MA model, it also considers the past values of the series in addition to the moving average of the error terms. The RMSE value of the MLP completely depends on the paramters we have chosen for the network and it cannot be generalised whether that value will always be greater or less than the ARMA and MA models.
